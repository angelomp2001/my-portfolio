        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer Behavior Analysis</strong>
                <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                <p>The primary goal of this project was to understand customer behavior. Conclusions of the final
                    analysis could contribute to driving operational efficiency, marketing, and revenue forecasting
                    decisions. The dataset included information about orders, products, and customers. The tasks
                    involved cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights into
                    customer shopping habits.</p>

                <h3>Methods Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Handled nonstandard formatting. Verified and corrected
                                values and data types.</li>
                            <li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> Identified missing values. Filled missing values using
                                appropriate strategies (e.g., drop, mean, max, min, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Duplicate Values:</strong> Removed duplicates.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Plots:</strong> Created plots such as histograms, box plots, and bar plots to
                                visualize the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aggregations and Groupings:</strong> Used group and aggregation functions to
                                explore additional data distributions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Problems Faced</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dataframes needed to be linked appropriately in order to conduct proper analysis.</li>
                    <li>Some columns had incorrect data types (e.g., order IDs as floats instead of integers).</li>
                    <li>Certain columns had missing values that needed to be handled appropriately, like subscription
                        end date.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Results Achieved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shoppers tended to buy between 10am - 4pm at the beginning of the week.</li>
                    <li>About half of shoppers submitted orders once every 2 weeks, and the other half once every month
                        or longer, on average.</li>
                    <li>The average customer ordered 3-10 products per order and placed between 1 and 5 orders during
                        the dataset time frame.</li>
                    <li>The most common items purchased were a wide variety of produce (bananas, avocados, etc.) and
                        milk.</li>
                    <li>Reorders (48% of all orders) were typically of the same perishable produce and milk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
